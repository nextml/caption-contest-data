"The outlook is bleak
So I tweet through this here beak
Feathers ruffled from the weather
On endeavors I seek

Our future is nested
In the eggs of the present
A valuable lesson often forgot 
For thoughts more pleasant

With my wing I strum these strings
And sing of things that may well bring
A swifter close to this chaotic state and a return to spring

A colloquial expression,
Perhaps you may have heard
Any blue jay can be shot
But it’s a sin to kill mockingbird",1.1076923076923078,0.049628799617553614,65,60,3,2
