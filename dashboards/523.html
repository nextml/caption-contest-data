65,25,11,Well at least they're not on our backs any more.
49,11,5,Planet of the Apes in 3D is a little too intense for me.
49,15,4,The bonus features on this new Planet Of The Apes BluRay might be a bit too much.
35,3,1,One of these monkeys must have some Shakespeare in him.
51,16,4,What else do we need besides bananas?
42,5,3,I told you not to vote for Trump.
36,6,0,I've been hanging with you for a long time Doris and I still can't figure out what you want.
37,8,1,I told you they were probably delivered in a barrel for a very good reason.
51,5,4,You just had to go to Costco and get a whole barrel.
44,12,3,Could it be that Nigerian email that we replied to?
43,6,3,Does this mean we can't have sex?
40,8,1,Anything would be more fun than this.
