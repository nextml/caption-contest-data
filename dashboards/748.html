Kristy puts the toilet paper roll on so the paper feeds from underneath and I just can’t wrap my brain around that logic. I prefer the over the top position. Aesthetically it’s just more pleasing. So, I go in and change it. The next day I go back in and it’s changed back. We don’t speak a word of this to each other. Just a quiet war of the toilet paper roll. And then I think, isthis it? Is this the rest of my life? Small wars around the house that are fought without a word spoken? I  don’t know. I guess I hate being lonely more than I hate fighting these passive aggressive wars ya know? Is marriage the compromise you make so you stop getting emails from Netflix because you’ve watched TNG for four days straight? Instead of getting wellness checks from my television subscription, I’ll just have to quietly endure the dishwasher being rearranged after I load it. Sorry. Just thinking out loud while we’re inside this whale.</td>
