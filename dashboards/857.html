We meet at the Natural History museum in the butterfly sanctuary and wow, the intimacy was right there, is like we have known each other forever. We had butterflies flying all around us, but he didn’t even look at them, nobody ever made me feel this way. It was a weekend of mating, and laying eggs, and morning bagels in bed. I mean, the flight will be significantly fuller by the time we arrive in Paris. Yes, I am taking them with me to France, is way better to hatch there. So… you are afraid of flying?</td>
