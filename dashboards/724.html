Like an homage to Proust. Like the character was reconnecting with memories of her nan through the plastic grapes, but they’re not the real grapes her nan fed her as a child, they’re plastic, right...? So, like, even our memories are artificial, mediated, irretrievable. I thought that was very interesting and I wanted to point it out.</td>
