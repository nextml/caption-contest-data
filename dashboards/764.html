            <td>(Alec Baldwin voice) At the tender age of twelve he returned home from a week long sleep away camp on the North Shore of Lake Superior called Camp Towanawana. It didn’t take long for him to notice his goldfish, who he affectionately named “Bobby” after his favorite uncle who passed away in a bizarre soap box derby accident, had gone missing. After hours of relentlessly questioning his mother, who he loved very deeply, she finally admitted that “Bobby” had decided to pack up his tank and move to the snowy mountains of Nepal. He accused her of telling the worst lie in history and never spoke to her again. Twelve days later she passed away in a similar, yet slightly different bizarre soap box derby accident. He refused to attend her funeral and instead rented a studio apartment in New York City’s Lower East Side. Many years later, as a self made millionaire having invented a better, safer soap box, he decided to trek the Nepalese mountains to find the inner peace he had always been missing. There at the top of an obscure peak nestled in a dark cave was Bobby. His mother, it seems, loved him very deeply and as it turned out never lied to him. He and Bobby shared a brief look, they silently nodded and he climbed down and went home. Shortly after he married and welcomed a son who he named Bobby. He has yet to visit his mother’s grave though he still loved her very deeply.</td>
