Today I went there in person for the first time and it was a tiny room with a man proudly displaying his Nurse Practitioner degree who didn't know what to say except that the last lady I saw quit and proceeded to tell me about what the form I already submitted was, in a way that implied I was too stupid to care (even more ironic is that we're waiting on him to sign it). The entire time, a silent woman sat adjacent transcribing the entire conversation as if somewhere between a court stenographer and piano maestro, both of them typing/composing what seemed to be an urgent concerto anytime I spoke. That's the environment they expect people to open up about their trauma in. Now look at this cartoon, and you tell me which scenario you think is weird.
